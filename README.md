# KlydziaThesis
This is the repository of R scripts that I use to make econometric models for my upcoming Master's thesis in economics. 

For downloading R please visit https://cran.r-project.org/

For the general scientific updates of my project see https://www.researchgate.net/project/The-impact-of-Labour-and-Capital-inputs-on-Production-and-Income-in-modern-economies-a-case-study-of-Lithuania-and-Poland

The thesis' updated name is: 
The Impact of Labour and Capital inputs on Production and Income in modern economies (a case study of Central and Eastern European countries)

I will try to add references to sources where I find the snippets that I use, modify and adapt to create my own models. 
In case I don't mention some source, please don't be mad, feel free to contact me via GitHub or social media (Rokis1990, Rokas Klyd≈æia).

I will mainly use: 
MicEcon https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/micEcon/index.html , 
MicEconCES https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/micEconCES/index.html
and vars https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/index.html
packages in R for the modelling and calculations.

This is not intended to be a sophisticated case of model building example, but rather just an archive, a repository in the new tradition of easily reproducible economic studies.

Personal reasons for using a public repository for the scripts of my experimental models include:
1) Publicity requires tidying up a bit.
2) I want to access my projects from any computer through the cloud. (?new to github, hope this works out)
3) ...
